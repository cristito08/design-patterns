# Prototype Pattern
In this project I applied the Prototype design pattern to an easy example.

## Getting Started
Open a command prompt and clone this repository in your computer:

```git clone ...```


## Prerequisites
You need to have installed node.js 8.11.3, and a code editor.


## Installing


## Test It
Open the project folder in your code editor, then open your terminal and type:

```npm start```

Press the Return key and wait until a new tab in your browser is open.

# Prototype Pattern
In this project I applied the Prototype design pattern to an easy example.

## Getting Started
Open a command prompt and clone this repository in your computer:

```git clone https://github.com/cristito08/design-patterns.git```


## Prerequisites
You need to have installed node.js 8.11.3, and a code editor.


## Installing
Open the project folder in your code editor, and istall the project dependencies typing:

```npm i``` 

Then to run the app in the browser type: 

```npm start```

Press the Return key and wait until a new tab in your browser is open.
